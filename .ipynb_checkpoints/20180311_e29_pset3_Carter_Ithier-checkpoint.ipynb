    "## PSet3 Problem by Phil\n",
    "\n",
    "As some of us may remember, the 2000 Presidential election was extremely close and hotly contested. Much of the drama occurred in the state of Florida, where many ballots had to be recounted by hand. As the recount progressed, the nation learned of some of the shortcomings of various schemes of ballot and voting machine design. Some of the factors that were investigated included the type of mechanism used to count votes, and the design of the ballot itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Florida election, each county used one of five methods to count votes:\n",
    "* Optical scanning of a paper ballot marked by filling in an oval next to the candidate's name\n",
    "* Votamatic machines, which require the voter to use a stylus to press out a perforated rectangle (a \"chad\") in a standard IBM punch card\n",
    "* Datavote machines, which use a similar mechanism to that of the Votamatic\n",
    "* Hand counting of a ballot filled out manually by the voter\n",
    "* Lever machines, which mechanically count the positions on a set of levers flipped by the voter\n",
    "\n",
    "Hand counting and lever machines are older methods that are rarely used today. Recent trends have been away from punch-card ballots toward either optical scanning or direct entry on an electronic touch-screen. In 2000, Florida used almost entirely either optical or punch-card systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "One significant problem in counting votes occurs when a voter fills out a ballot incorrectly. In many local elections one can vote for two or more candidates for a given position, up to a maximum. (For example, you might see an instruction like \"Vote for any THREE\" next to a list of ten candidates for three open positions on the local school board. If a voter's ballot shows choices for only one or two candidates in a multiple-choice race, or shows no choice at all for a single-choice race like President, this may have been his or her intention; *OR* the ballot may have been incorrectly marked, or may have been counted incorrectly by a machine. This situation is called an \"undervote\". Similarly, the voter's ballot may show more than the allowed number of candidates, an \"overvote\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Another factor that can cause problems is whether the candidates' names are listed in a single column or in two columns. The two-column arrangement (the infamous \"butterfly ballot\") arranged the names to the left and right of a single column of hole-punch locations, accommodating the small width of the IBM punch card placed below the sheet that lists the candidates. This arrangement may make it more difficult to identify the correct location to punch, leading to ballots whose markings do not reflect the voter's intention. \n",
    "\n",
    "While undervotes and overvotes may not invalidate an entire ballot, how often they occur can tell us something about the relative reliability of different technologies and ballot designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of the various ballots used recently in the U.S. can be seen here: https://www.verifiedvoting.org/resources/voting-equipment/. Images of the one- and two-column ballot shapes can be seen here: www.nytimes.com/images/2001/11/12/politics/recount/index_BALLOT.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some of the results compiled during the Florida 2000 recount. Note that there were several minor-party candidates besides Bush and Gore, but we'll focus on those two.\n",
    "The fl2000.csv file contains the vote counts for each candidate in each county, along with:\n",
    "* the type of technology used to count votes\n",
    "* the number of columns on the ballot\n",
    "* the number of undervotes and overvotes\n",
    "\n",
    "This data was compiled by Brett Presnell of the University of Florida Statistics Department.\n",
    "\n",

    "This is an important step for us to eventually build a predictive model. We need to understand what our data looks like and what additional processing (if any) we might need to do in order to generate features for our model. I've provided you with three files: `2012_2017_box_scores.csv`, `2012_2017_schedules.csv`, and `2012_2017_season_player_stats.csv`. As you can see, the data provided is for the NBA regular season for a 6-year period between 2012 and 2017. (If you're wondering why the cut-off was somewhat arbitrarily decided to be 2012, that's because the 2011-2012 season was cut short by a player lockout.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started by reading in our data using `pd.read_csv()`. Note that you might end up with an extra column if you don't pass in a value for the optional parameter `index_col`. This is because these files were previously created by `pd.to_csv()`, which by default exports a DataFrame's index as a regular column. The `index_col` parameter will allow us to read that column as the index, and our DataFrame will look normal again. This is especially useful for datasets with irregular indices!"
